# Apt Package Installation Script
A repo containing all the system tweaks I use when I set up a new Ubuntu laptop.

Simply run the `install_useful_packages.sh` script when setting up a new computer. Add apt package names as a new line in the `useful_packages` file in order to have them run by the script.
